Add AJAX navigation to a Plone site.

This is probably not the most advanced or state-of-the-art way to add AJAX
navigation; for Plone 5, I was told about `plone.patternslib`_, based on
`patternslib`_.

For `Volto`_ sites, the whole jQuery-based handling might be obsolete because
of the use of `React.js`_.

At the time of this writing, those were no options for me since I was still on
Plone 4.3.  Thus, I needed a working solution.
Depending on the quality, I'll switch to some Plone-5-ish solution when doing
the leap, or I'll stick with my own.

The general idea is:

- Catch the ``click`` event for every ``a`` element on the page.

- For some links, a special check will tell to proceed with the standard
  behaviour, i.e. load the target the standard way; this includes:

  - Link targets outside of the current site (another hostname is given)
  - Management pages (e.g. starting with ``manage_``)
  - Other pages which don't load the navigation links etc. anyway,
    or wouldn't work when loaded via AJAX
  - Anchor elements with certain attributes
  - Views for contexts which don't have a suitable embedable view yet.

  For such link targets, this function will simply return *true*,
  and the page is loaded in the standard way.

- If that check function concludes, "let's load the target via AJAX",
  it will look for certain elements on the page and try to update them:

  - ``content``

    and, optionally:

  - breadcrumbs
  - other page elements

  It will also set the page url and title accordingly
  (from the ``@url`` and ``@title`` keys of the JSON reply, respectively),
  allowing for the browser history.

- If the tried URLs fail to return a usable JSON answer,
  or if the target URL is inappropriate for other reasons
  (e.g. page-local, or leaving the current site),
  the target page is loaded the normal, non-AJAX way
  (i.e., loading the whole page).


Features
--------

- Tries up to two URLs for each ``a`` element (only one, it the target URL ends
  with "``/``", or if the final path element can be considered a view method
  name rather than an object id)
- Can be configured using the Plone registry.


To do
-----

- Provide ``@@embed`` views for all standard objects.
- Provide ``@@please_login`` and ``@@insufficient_rights`` views.
- Use a `web worker`_.
- Find reliable CSS destination selectors for the ``content``.
- Make this package RequireJS_-aware.


Examples
--------

This add-on is currently under development and not yet used on public internet
sites.


Documentation
-------------

Full documentation for end users can be found in the "docs" folder.


Installation
------------

Install visaplan.plone.ajaxnavigation_ by adding it to your buildout::

    [buildout]

    ...

    eggs =
        visaplan.plone.ajaxnavigation


and then running ``bin/buildout``.

Or, more likely:

Add it to the dependencies of your package, e.g. in your ``setup.py`` file.

You'll need to provide ``@@embed`` views for your content types;
ideally, you can use your already-existing ``BrowserView`` classes.
